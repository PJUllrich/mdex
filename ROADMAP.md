# Roadmap

- High-level API to manipulate the AST, built on top of the low-level `traverse_and_update/2` function.
- Plugin system, based on Req plugins (pipeline of attached functions).
- A sigil to generate [%Phoenix.LiveView.Generated{}](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.Rendered.html), ie: render markdown in LiveViews.
